# Feature 007: V2 Production Migration

## Goal

Replace legacy player architecture with the clean v2 implementation, promoting the validated prototype to production code while preserving functionality and improving maintainability.

## Migration Overview

Moved clean v2 Player/Scheduler architecture from `player/v2/` up one level to `player/`, completely replacing legacy code with modern, modular implementation.

## What Was Replaced

### Legacy Code Removed

- Old Player/Scheduler classes (`player/js/sw-player.js`, `player/js/services/LayoutScheduler.js`)
- Legacy components (`SwLayout.js`, `SwMedia.js`, `SwPlaylist.js`)
- Old media handlers (`ImageMediaHandler.js`, `VideoMediaHandler.js`)
- Outdated UI components (`DebugPanel.js`, `ProgressBar.js`)
- Legacy test files and utilities
- Old CSS and HTML entry points

### Clean V2 Architecture Promoted

- **Core Classes**: Clean Player.js (188 lines), Scheduler.js (297 lines)
- **Modular Helpers**: RegionWiring, PlayerPlayback, LayoutDom, CronUtils, transformers
- **Media System**: BaseMedia, ImageMedia, VideoMedia, MediaFactory, Playlist orchestration
- **Working Demo**: Functional `player/demo.html` with live API integration

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### Size Reduction

- Player: 456→188 lines (59% reduction)
- Scheduler: 774→297 lines (62% reduction)
- All helper modules under 100 lines each

### Clean Separation

- Player: Pure content rendering only
- Scheduler: Configuration, timing, media preloading
- Helpers: Single responsibility modules

### Modern Features

- ES6+ modules and classes
- Real ScreenWerk Publisher API integration
- Seamless video/image loop optimization
- Event-driven playlist progression
- Comprehensive error handling

## Success Criteria

- Demo functionality preserved (`player/demo.html` works)
- All media types supported (image, video) with playlist orchestration
- Live API integration functional
- Modular architecture with size limits respected
- No regression in core player capabilities

## Implementation Strategy

### Migration Approach

1. Developed clean architecture in isolated `player/v2/` folder
2. Iteratively refined through Features 004, 005, 006
3. Validated functionality with working demo
4. Replaced legacy code in single atomic operation
5. Preserved working demo as validation proof

### Quality Assurance

- All sanity checks pass
- ESLint compliant throughout
- Working demo validates live functionality
- No breaking changes to external interfaces

```

## Runtime Validation

Demo tested with:

- Live ScreenWerk Publisher API calls
- Real media loading and display
- Playlist progression with 10s timing
- Video loop optimization
- Layout switching functionality

## Next Phase Opportunities

With clean architecture in place, future development can focus on:

- Advanced features (multi-layout sequences, overlays)
- Developer tooling (testing, debugging, metrics)
- Performance optimization (advanced caching, analytics)
- Ecosystem integration (plugins, APIs, monitoring)
