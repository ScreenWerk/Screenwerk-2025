# AI Workspace

This directory contains AI assistant-generated and managed documentation for the SW25 project.

## Purpose

The `.ai_workspace` serves as a dedicated space for:

- **AI Assistant Activity Tracking** - Maintaining logs of all AI assistant actions and decisions
- **Working Drafts** - Storing AI-generated documents before integration into the main project
- **Analysis Documents** - Housing AI-created analysis, plans, and recommendations
- **Documentation Workspace** - Providing a space for collaborative document development

## Contents

### `activity-log.md`

Comprehensive timestamped log of all AI assistant activities including:

- Documentation reviews and updates
- Code analysis and modifications
- Project planning and recommendations
- File creation and organization tasks

### `Project Reorganization Plan.md`

Working copy of the project restructuring plan, allowing for iterative updates and refinements before finalizing changes to the main project structure.

## Usage Guidelines

- **AI Assistant**: All AI-generated content should be logged in `activity-log.md`
- **Developers**: Review AI recommendations and analysis documents before implementing changes
- **Documentation**: Use this space for collaborative document development before moving finalized versions to appropriate project locations

## File Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `activity-log.md`)
- Include descriptive names that clearly indicate content purpose
- Add timestamps to version-specific documents when needed

## Integration Workflow

1. AI assistant creates/updates documents in `.ai_workspace`
2. Review and refine content collaboratively
3. Move finalized documents to appropriate project locations
4. Update `activity-log.md` with integration actions

*This workspace maintains separation between AI-generated content and production code while enabling collaborative refinement of documentation and planning materials.*
