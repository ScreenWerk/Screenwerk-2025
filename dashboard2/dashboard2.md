# Dashboard2 Requirements and Ideas

## New Features
- Layout should fit in three columns:
  - 400px wide for ScreenWerk elements.
  - 200px wide for toolboxes.
  - The rest of the screen to the right is for player preview and other context information (e.g., configuration JSON).
- Toolboxes should appear only for configuration and screen group elements.

## Ideas
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements.
- Add search functionality to quickly find configurations or screen groups.
- Add tooltips to provide more information about each element.

## Further ideas
- Implement a dark mode for better user experience in low-light environments.
- Provide export options for configurations and screen groups.
